## Hello, I'm Aman Chandel

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer and AI Enthusiast with a deep love for creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and real-world problems. Based in India, I specialize in building scalable web applications and exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.

## My Journey

My journey into technology began with curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. What started as simple HTML pages has evolved into a comprehensive understanding of modern web development, from frontend frameworks to backend architectures, and now into the exciting realm of AI and machine learning.

## What I Do

### Full Stack Development

I build end-to-end web applications using modern technologies. On the frontend, I work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. For backend development, I leverage Node.js, Python, Express.js, and FastAPI to build robust server-side applications. I'm experienced with various databases including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I deploy applications using cloud platforms like AWS and Vercel with proper CI/CD pipelines.

### AI & Machine Learning

I'm deeply fascinated by AI and actively work on building intelligent applications with Large Language Models, developing computer vision projects, and exploring natural language processing. I stay updated with the latest AI tools and frameworks, constantly experimenting with new technologies to understand their potential applications in real-world scenarios.

## My Philosophy

I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems. Every project I work on is driven by the question: "How can this make someone's life better?" Whether it's streamlining a business process, creating an engaging user experience, or building an AI-powered solution, I'm always focused on delivering value and creating meaningful impact through technology.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading about the latest tech trends and AI developments to stay current with the rapidly evolving technology landscape. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and staying active. I'm passionate about continuous learning and regularly experiment with new technologies to expand my skill set. I also enjoy collaborating with other developers and contributing to open source projects that benefit the developer community.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss new opportunities, collaborate on interesting projects, or simply chat about technology and AI. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together or just have a conversation about the amazing world of software development.
